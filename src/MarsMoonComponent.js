        description2:"Ninety-four years later, NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft got a much better look at the two moons from its orbit around Mars. The dominant feature on Phobos, it found, was a crater six miles (10 kilometers) wideâ€”nearly half the width of the moon itself. It was given Angelina's maiden name: Stickney.",
